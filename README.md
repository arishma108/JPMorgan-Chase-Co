Data visualization and analysis in real time.

# Brief: 
A trader from the equities team (publicly listed company stocks) has requested functionality be added to their dashboard to allow them to input specific information so they can monitor a new trading strategy.

# Project Outline: 
Develop an alternative way to visualize and analyze share price data for traders to alert them of potential trading opportunities.

JPMorgan Chase has traders in all the major financial centers and creates a marketplace for asset classes around the globe for our investor clients.

Trading teams are organized by asset class: 
- Equities (stocks) 
- Commodities Credit (debt and bonds) 
- Currency & Emerging Markets 
- Public Finance (Government bonds) 
- Interest rates 
- Securitized Products

# Requirements: 
1. System setup in order to interface with the relevant financial data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to visualize and analyze this data in real time.
2. Implement Perspective to facilitate the trader’s requested changes and deliver actionable insights. Gain an understanding of the user requirements and then build something that meets those requirements.
